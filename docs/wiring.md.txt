# Wiring Guide for ESP32 HTTP Server


## Built-in LED
Most ESP32-S3 boards already include an onboard LED. This project uses `LED_BUILTIN` by default.


### Common LED pins:
- GPIO 13 (some ESP32-S3 Dev boards)
- GPIO 21 (alternative)
- GPIO 38 (alternative)


If the onboard LED does not work, uncomment one of the alternative pin definitions in the code and connect an external LED:
- Connect LED anode (+) to the chosen GPIO pin
- Connect LED cathode (-) through a 220Î© resistor to GND


## Power
- Connect the ESP32 board via USB cable to your computer for programming and power.


## WiFi
- No extra wiring needed. Just configure your SSID and password in the code.
